## Contributing

If you spot a bug or want to contribute feel free to create an issue.

## Requirements

-   A Linux server (tested with Ubuntu 18.04)
-   Node.js >= 12
-   pm2 globally installed
-   SSL certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt)

## Setup

-   Clone the repository
-   In `/server` & in `/client`:
    -   `npm ci`
    -   Copy `.env.example`
    -   Rename to `.env`
    -   Enter your specific config values
-   You can run the following commands with a preceding space, preventing the passwords from being written into your bash history.
-   In `/server/build`: Create an admin user:
    -   Choose an excellent & unique password!
    -   In `/server/build/admin-cli`: `[SPACE] node admin.js create-user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> admin`
-   In `/server`: Create other users:
    -   Choose a good & unique password! Users can upload arbitrary files to your server.
    -   In `/server/build/admin-cli`: `[SPACE] node admin.js create-user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>`

## Production

-   If required, configure the `.env` files to run the app exposing only a local port and use a reverse proxy (see example below)
-   Make sure your firewall is configured correctly
-   You might want to use a tool like `authbind` to run pm2 without root; see https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/specifics/#listening-on-port-80-w-o-root
-   In `/server`: `npm run deploy`

        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }

    location /peerjs/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/peerjs/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;

```

## Development

-   In `/client`: `npm ci && npm start`
-   In `/server`: `npm ci && npm start`

### Architecture

The server is written in Express, using Sequelize, sqlite, express-session. Cookie-based authentication: Passport.js.
The client is a React application in TypeScript.

Realtime communication is realized with Socket.io.

In production mode, the client application is delivered via the back end app. If you run `npm run deploy` the `build` folder's contents are copied into the `client-build` dir of the server, whose `index.html` is statically served to all requests except those routed to `/api/...`. A reverse proxy like nginx is needed to use HTTPS. You can find an example configuration above.

In development, you'll run the front end via the webpack dev server included in `create-react-app`.

### Documentation

Autogenerated API documentation is found under `/server/doc/index.html`. This document is generated everytime you `npm start` your dev server.

## Admin CLI

In `/server/build/admin-cli`: `admin.js` +

-   `[SPACE] create-user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> [admin]`
-   `list-users`
-   `delete-user <USERNAME>`
-   `delete-all-users`
-   `[SPACE] change-password <USERNAME> <NEW PASSWORD>`
